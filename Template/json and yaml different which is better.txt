json and yaml different which is better



********************************
JSON better for api 






********************************
YAML is a superset of JSON, which means you can parse JSON with a YAML parser. Betcha didn’t know that!

#############################
one of the best advantage is 
"YAML is that it supports comments". 
##########################
This is very useful especially when you use it for configuration.


-YAML-based templates use less punctuation(विराम चिन्हन) and should be substantially easier to write and to read. 



-It is far better suited for configuration than JSON

-YAML has a couple of big advantages over JSON, including the ability to self reference, support for complex datatypes, embedded block literals, comments, and more.

Example YAML File:


{
  "Parameters" : {
    "KeyName" : {
      "Description" : "The EC2 Key Pair to allow SSH access to the instance",
      "Type" : "AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName"
    }
  },
  "Resources" : {
    "Ec2Instance" : {
      "Type" : "AWS::EC2::Instance",
      "Properties" : {
        "SecurityGroups" : [ "MyExistingSecurityGroup" ],
        "KeyName" : { "Ref" : "KeyName"},
        "ImageId" : "ami-6869aa05"
      }
    }
  }
}
