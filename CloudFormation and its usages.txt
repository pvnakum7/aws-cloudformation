CloudFormation
 
 What, why , where cloudformation is require?

--AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model
and set up your Amazon Web Services resources so that 
you can spend less time managing those resources and 
more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS.


--AWS CLoudformation enable you to manage your complate
infrastructure or AWS resources through a trext file.

CloudFormation features
****************************************
1.
-Nested stacks
	They allowed me to encapsulate logical areas of
	functionality or usage within my templates and
	make large or complex stacks more manageable

					Stack
					  |
			------------------------	  
			|						|
			|						|
			VPC						App	
		-------------				---
		|			|		  		|			
		Az			Az				DB


2.
Lambda-backed custom resources	
	-Lambda-backed custom resources allow me to
	implement custom actions during template 
	instantiation outside of those AWS resources that
	are created for the stack itself.

3.
Change sets	
	-Change sets allow you to see or inspect changes
	that CloudFormation will make to your stack before 
	actually applying them. This makes it much easier 
	to make changes to CloudFormation templates and 
	validate that what you intend to change as a 
	result of the update is the only thing that is 
	going to change.

4.
YAML





5.
A gateway to infrastructure as code

	I use SQS and S3, EC2, RDS, Lambda, and SageMaker 
	like everyone else. These are the services we all 
	typically use to build our software and services 
	on AWS. But when I want to “build” infrastructure 
	on AWS, I always turn to CloudFormation
